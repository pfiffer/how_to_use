Files included:

1- Direct.m: Comprised of main loops connecting to NPV.m and the plotting sections
2- NPV.m: Takes well positions from Direct.m and assings it to ECLDATA variable and sends it to Eclipse.m
3- Eclipse.m: Takes well positions from NPV.m and writes them to "sched.m" on 5th line after the "WELSPECS". Then calls Retina or ECLIPSE software using dos('$multirun.bat') command. We have used Retina software, but there is no difference if you use ECLIPSE. Therefore we configured files so as to be run by ECLIPSE.
   Finally, extracts FOPT, FWPT, and FWIT from "HTCM.data" and send them back to NPV.m to calculate the Net Present Value
4- Perm-het.txt: Conatains the heterogenous permeability values.
5- sched.dat: Contains well locations.
6- Perm-het.txt: Permeability distribution file to be loaded from MATLAB.
12- FMM_2: Function to calculate Time of Flight and drainage boundaries.


Enter the number of grid blocks in x- and y-direction in line 15. Default is 25 for the both directions.
To convert the permeability values to a matrix representing the model, two "for" loops are used. Specify the number of columns in the permeability file in line 21. Default is 25.


****** Enter the location of production wells in line 49 to calculate the Time of Flight and drainage boundaries. ********

Note: The original file is arranged for heterogeneous cases. If you want to change it to a homogenous one, you should make the following changes to some file:
1- Uncomment lines 158 to 160 in HTCM.data file.
2- Comment lines 17 to 29 and uncomment lines 33 to 35 in Main.m file

3- Also, uncomment lines 35 and 35, then comment lines 45, 47-49 and uncomment line 46.

Start of the Fast Marching Method Function

Time of Flight and drainage area of each production wells are assigned to TOF and Index variables resepetively in line 44.
Afterwards, regions where indices from wells are different are determined using Index variable to determine the drainage boundary.
This region is taken as the search domain of the optimization algorithm.

TOF and Index is calculated using "FMM_2" function. This function takes the production well positions and permeability as the input data. Note: Drainage boundaries can also be estimated using codes developed by Mohammad Sabry Hassouna which are located at https://github.com/rezayusefzadeh/how_to_use/tree/FMM which is more efficient.
Next, you should specify the number and dimension of grid blocks of the model and the other properties of the fluid and rock to calculate the diffusivity constant.
Index of each region is calculated and assigned to FPI (Frozen Points Index) variable and returned.

End of the Fast Marching Method Function

Output files:
Three output files are provided to test the drainage boundaries. Black squares on the figures indicate the location of production wells. 

1- "Drainage boundary of 4 prod wells heterogeneous case.fig"

2- "Drainage boundary of 4 prod wells homogeneous case.fig"

Software Requirements:
		You need to have Retina or Eclipse 2010.1 and Octave 4.4.1 or MATLAB R2013a or higher versions to run these files.
		Note: we have used Octave but there is no difference if you use MATLAB

Note: If you are using MATLAB R2015a, you need to change the 47th line of the Eclipse.m to:
""""""""""""""""	AA = cell2mat(A.textdata(4));	""""""""""""""""""""""
