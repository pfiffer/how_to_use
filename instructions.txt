Instructions to use the Direct Search Method on the Synthetic models

Files included:
1- Direct.m: Comprised of main loops connecting to NPV.m and the plotting sections. You should run this file
2- NPV.m: This is a function which takes well positions from Direct.m and assings it to ECLDATA variable and sends it to Eclipse.m
3- Eclipse.m: Contains Eclips() function which takes well positions from NPV.m and writes them to "sched.m" on 5th line after the "WELSPECS". Then calls ECLIPSE software using dos('$multirun.bat') command.
   Finally, extracts FOPT, FWPT, and FWIT from "HTCM.data" and send them back to NPV.m to calculate the Net Present Value
4- Perm-het.txt: Conatains the heterogenous permeability values.
5- sched.dat: Contains well locations.
6- Perm-het.txt: Permeability distribution file to be loaded from MATLAB.


To use this method you should provide the upper bounds of the model under investigation to be used in the main loops.
The systhetic models provided for validation in the included file has 25 by 25 grid blocks that are entered in lines 23 to 25.

Note: The original file is arranged for heterogeneous cases. If you want to change it to a homogenous one, you should make the following changes to some file:
1- Uncomment lines 158 to 160 in HTCM.data file.
2- As the NPV map will be symmetric, it will be enough to calculate only a quarter of the NPV map and finally replicate it to other parts
	So, you should change the upper bounds of the "for" loops to "13".

3- Also, uncomment lines 35 and 35, then comment lines 45, 47-49 and uncomment line 46.

Output files: Two output files are provided here for test.
1- "NPV_Map_Hetero_4Production.fig"
2- "NPV_Map_Homogeneous_4Production"


Software Requirements:
		You need to have Eclipse 2010.1 and MATLAB R2013a or higher versions to run these files.

Note: If you are using MATLAB R2015a, you need to change the 47th line of the Eclipse.m to:
""""""""""""""""	AA = cell2mat(A.textdata(4));	""""""""""""""""""""""
